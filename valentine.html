                <p>Dear Tanaka,<br>
                There are a lot of things I wish to say to you, I wish we spoke sooner, I wish we understood each other ealier, I wish we became friends sooner and most of all, I wish I could express my feelings to you sooner. You have been an amazing person to me, you have shown not just appreciation but kindness to me. As cliche as it may sound, you look at me like there is something in me worth looking at and it makes want to do more for you while I wonder what else I can do to see that smile on your face that I adore. Everytime I lean more about you, I see a lot more to love about you. Never the less, I do thank GOD for everytime we spend time together even if they were for a short period of time. My queen and more, smile more, SLAY more, may GOD help you to shine more in everything you do and have a blessed day.  <br>With much love, <br>Ben</p>
